This is set of workshop materials developed for running workshops to bring together ecologists interested in AI tools and data scientists interested in working on AI applications from Colombia and Ecuador. The initial workshop was run in April 2025. Participants were selected based on potential impact on their community, their readiness to contribute to the topic, and a broad category of representation, which balanced geographic origin, business versus academic experience, and career progression.
